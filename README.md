## 🌍 Introduction  

**EcoWattAI** is an AI-powered platform that helps households and organizations **reduce energy waste, lower electricity bills, and cut carbon emissions**.  
It acts as a **smart energy coach**, analyzing usage patterns, detecting inefficiencies, and providing actionable optimization suggestions.  

👉 *Because every watt saved is a step toward a cleaner future.*  

---

## 🚀 Key Features  

- **AI Analytics** → Detects energy usage patterns & inefficiencies.  
- **Smart Suggestions** → Personalized tips to cut waste (e.g., shift appliance usage to off-peak hours).  
- **Gamification** → Earn badges, track a “Green Score,” and see your CO₂ impact as *trees planted*.  
- **Real-Time Simulation** → Compare *Before vs After* optimization with live graphs.   
- **Impact Calculator** → Convert saved kWh into CO₂ avoided and cost savings.  

---

## 📊 How It Works  

1. **Upload Data** – Import CSV/Excel of energy usage.  
2. **Data Cleaning** – System normalizes and prepares your dataset.  
3. **ML Analysis** –  
   - Linear Regression → predicts future usage.  
   - K-Means Clustering → identifies peak hours.  
4. **Optimization Suggestions** – Actionable advice to reduce waste.  
5. **Impact Tracking** – View cost savings, CO₂ avoided, and trees planted.
